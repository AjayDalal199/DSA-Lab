DSA with C lab assignments for college.
Data Structures Lab List of practical exercises, to be implemented in C Language.
1. Write a menu driven program that implements following operations (using separate functions) on a linear array:
  a. Insert a new element at end as well as at a given position
  b. Delete an element from a given whose value is given or whose position is given
  c. To find the location of a given element
  d. To display the elements of the linear array
2. Write a menu driven program that maintains a linear linked list whose elements are stored in on ascending order and implements the following operations (using separate functions):
  a. Insert a new element
  b. Delete an existing element
  c. Search an element
  d. Display all the elements
3. Write a program to demonstrate the use of stack (implemented using linear array) in converting arithmetic expression from infix notation to postfix notation.
4. Program to demonstrate the use of stack (implemented using linear linked lists) in evaluating arithmetic expression in postfix notation.
5. Program to demonstration the implementation of various operations on a linear queue represented using a linear array.
6. Program to demonstration the implementation of various operations on a circular queue represented using a linear array.
7. Program to demonstration the implementation of various operations on a queue represented using a linear linked list (linked queue).
8. Program to illustrate the implementation of different operations on a binary search tree.
9. Program to illustrate the traversal of graph using breadth-first search
